# Geo-locate Node.js Web Application

This is my follow along of the tutorial by "The Coding Train" for practicing building a simple node.js server using express, and vanilla JS + HTML for the front end.

The web page allows you to find your location using the Navigator geo-locate browser functionality and displays it on an interactive map.
You can also view a log of all geo-location requests as well as their co-ordinates.
